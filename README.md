# Robot Vision Fall 2017 - Copycat Drone
The project consists of a drone that copies the movement of another one through the Natural Point OptiTrack motion capture system. This was developed within the ROS Kinetic Kame framework making use of the Virtual Reality Peripheral Network protocol  for positioning; proportional-integral-derivative controllers for movement  and the ardrone-autonomy ROS package for drone communication. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For the porject to run, a system with the following software is required:

```
- Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
- ROS Kinetic Kame desktop full
- git
```

The following ROS packages are required:

```
- ardrone_autonomy
- vrpn_client_ros
- pid
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
