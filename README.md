# Robot Vision Fall 2017 - Copycat Drone
The project consists of a drone that copies the movement of another one through the Natural Point OptiTrack motion capture system. This was developed within the ROS Kinetic Kame framework making use of the Virtual Reality Peripheral Network protocol  for positioning; proportional-integral-derivative controllers for movement  and the ardrone-autonomy ROS package for drone communication.
